Title: File Operations and Cross Compilation

Abstract:
This assignment focuses on File Operations and Cross Compilation, two important topics in the field of software development.
The assignment aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of file handling in various programming languages and the concept of cross compilation.
Students will learn how to perform common file operations, such as reading, writing, and manipulating files, and gain insights into cross-compiling software for different target architectures.
The assignment includes theoretical explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to enhance students' learning experience.

Assignment: 1 - File Operations

Exercise 1: Write a C program that reads a file, counts the number of words, and displays the result.

#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_LENGTH 100

int countWords(FILE *file) {
    int wordCount = 0;
    char ch;
    int inWord = 0;

    while ((ch = fgetc(file)) != EOF) {
        if (ch == ' ' || ch == '\n' || ch == '\t') {
            inWord = 0;
        } else if (inWord == 0) {
            inWord = 1;
            wordCount++;
        }
    }

    return wordCount;
}

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    char fileName[MAX_LENGTH];
    int wordCount;

    printf("Enter the file name: ");
    scanf("%s", fileName);

    file = fopen(fileName, "r");

    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("File not found or unable to open.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    wordCount = countWords(file);

    printf("Number of words in the file: %d\n", wordCount);

    fclose(file);

    return 0;
}


Conclusion:
In conclusion, this assignment provides students with a comprehensive understanding of file operations and cross compilation.
By completing the exercises, students will gain practical experience in performing file handling tasks in different programming languages and cross-compiling software for various target architectures.
These skills are crucial for software developers, especially those working on cross-platform projects or embedded systems.
Mastering file operations and cross compilation will enhance students' ability to efficiently work with files and deploy software on diverse hardware platforms.
